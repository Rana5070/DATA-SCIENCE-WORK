# DATA-SCIENCE-WORK -- PakWheels Data set
I worked on the PakWheels dataset from Kaggle (about 89,900 records). 
The project involved cleaning and structuring the raw data, extracting meaningful variables, and building clear visualizations to highlight price trends, mileage patterns, brand comparisons, and city-wise distributions. 
I also ran statistical checks to validate the results and ensure the insights were reliable. 
The goal wasn’t just analysis it was hands-on practice in handling a large real-world dataset and producing usable findings.
